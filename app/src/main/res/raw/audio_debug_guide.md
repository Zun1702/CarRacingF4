# 🔊 Audio Testing Guide

## 🎵 What Should You Hear Now:

### 1. Racing Music:
- **soundrace.mp3** should play when you start RacingActivity
- Check Android Logcat for debug messages:
  - "SoundManager initialized"
  - "Racing music started"
  - "MediaPlayer created: true"

### 2. Countdown Sounds:
- **Beep sounds** during 3-2-1 countdown
- **Alert sound** when "GO!" appears
- Check Logcat for: "Countdown: 3", "Countdown: 2", "Countdown: 1", "Race started!"

### 3. Engine Sounds:
- Currently silent (need engine_sound.mp3)
- But engine sound calls are active in code

## 🔍 Debugging Steps:

### Check Audio Volume:
1. Make sure device volume is UP
2. Make sure app isn't muted
3. Try using headphones

### Check Logcat:
```
adb logcat | grep -E "(SoundManager|RacingActivity)"
```

### Check Settings:
- Music enabled: Check `soundManager.isMusicEnabled()`
- Sound enabled: Check `soundManager.isSoundEnabled()`

## 🎯 Expected Log Output:
```
D/RacingActivity: SoundManager initialized. Music enabled: true
D/SoundManager: playRacingMusic called. Music enabled: true
D/SoundManager: Creating MediaPlayer for soundrace.mp3
D/SoundManager: MediaPlayer created: true
D/SoundManager: Racing music started successfully
D/RacingActivity: Countdown: 3
D/SoundManager: playSound called: button_click, enabled: true
D/SoundManager: System beep played for: button_click
```
